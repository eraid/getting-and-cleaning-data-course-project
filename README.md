1. Title: Getting and Cleaning Data: Merging and Organizing Data 

# Course Project:

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 

  -- a tidy data set as described below, 
  -- a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 
  -- a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts.
  
2. File description.

  -- README.md: this file
  -- CodeBook.md: describes the variables and the transformations needed to clean up the data
  -- download-dataset.R:script that download and unzip the dataset dataset in data folder
  -- run_analysis.R: script that transformand clean the data
  -- tidy_dataset.txt: final tidy dataset
